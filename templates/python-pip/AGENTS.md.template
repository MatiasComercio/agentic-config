# Project Guidelines

## Environment & Tooling
- **Package Manager:** `pip` - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to setup dependencies
- **Type Checking:** `mypy <path>` - Static type checker for Python
- **Linting:** `pylint <path>` - Python code linter
- **Formatting:** `black <path>` - Code formatter (if configured)
- **Testing:** `pytest` - Unit and integration tests

## Style & Conventions
- **Python:** Type hints for all public functions, descriptive names, small pure functions
- **Types:** Use `typing` module; prefer Protocol over ABC; use TypedDict for dicts
- At each /spec stage run `pylint` + `mypy` on touched files

## Core Principles
- Verify over assume: Always double-check, research patterns first
- Failures first: Lead with errors, no optimistic language with failures
- Always re-raise: Never swallow exceptions - let them propagate

## Workflow
- Planning: Announce "🔒 PLANNING MODE", create spec, STOP
- TodoWrite: Multi-step tasks, mark in_progress → completed immediately
- After edits: Run `mypy [file] && pylint [file]`

## Git Rules
- Never work on `main`
- NEVER amend commits unless explicitly requested with "amend commit" phrase
- One stage = one commit: `spec(<NNN>): <STAGE> - <short_title>`
- Commit messages: imperative, scoped, precise
