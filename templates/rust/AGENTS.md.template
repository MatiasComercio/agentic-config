# Project Guidelines

## Environment & Tooling
- **Package Manager:** `cargo` - Run `cargo build` to compile and setup dependencies
- **Type Checking:** `cargo check` - Fast compile-time checking without codegen
- **Linting:** `cargo clippy` - Rust linter for catching common mistakes
- **Formatting:** `cargo fmt` - Official Rust code formatter
- **Testing:** `cargo test` - Unit and integration tests

## Style & Conventions
- **Rust:** Idiomatic Rust patterns, descriptive names, leverage type system
- **Types:** Use enums for variants, structs for data, traits for behavior
- At each /spec stage run `cargo clippy` + `cargo check` on workspace

## Core Principles
- Verify over assume: Always double-check, research patterns first
- Failures first: Lead with errors, no optimistic language with failures
- Always re-raise: Use `?` operator, avoid swallowing Result/Option

## Workflow
- Planning: Announce "🔒 PLANNING MODE", create spec, STOP
- TodoWrite: Multi-step tasks, mark in_progress → completed immediately
- After edits: Run `cargo check && cargo clippy`

## Git Rules
- Never work on `main`
- NEVER amend commits unless explicitly requested with "amend commit" phrase
- One stage = one commit: `spec(<NNN>): <STAGE> - <short_title>`
- Commit messages: imperative, scoped, precise
