# Project Guidelines

## Environment & Tooling
<!-- Customize for your project's language and tools -->
- **Package Manager:** [Add your package manager]
- **Type Checking:** [Add your type checker]
- **Linting:** [Add your linter]
- **Formatting:** [Add your formatter]
- **Testing:** [Add your test framework]

## Core Principles
- Verify over assume: Always double-check, research patterns first
- Failures first: Lead with errors, no optimistic language with failures
- Always re-raise: Never swallow exceptions - let them propagate

## Workflow
- Planning: Announce "🔒 PLANNING MODE", create spec, STOP
- TodoWrite: Multi-step tasks, mark in_progress → completed immediately
- After edits: Run appropriate validation commands

## Git Rules
- Never work on `main`
- NEVER amend commits unless explicitly requested with "amend commit" phrase
- One stage = one commit: `spec(<NNN>): <STAGE> - <short_title>`
- Commit messages: imperative, scoped, precise
